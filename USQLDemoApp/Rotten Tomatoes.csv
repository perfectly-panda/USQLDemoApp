Original, .78, .85, 3, "Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy and the USS Enterprise crew seek out new civilizations in this seminal sci-fi series."
Discovery, .81, .56, 1, "The series follows the voyages of Starfleet on their missions to discover new worlds and new life forms, and one Starfleet officer who must learn that to truly understand all things alien, you must first understand yourself."
Enterprise, .50, .65, 4, "The adventures of Earth's first interstellar spaceship are chronicled in this 'Star Trek' spin-off, which takes place in 2151 (a century before Capt. Kirk). It follows Capt. Jonathan Archer and his crew as they explore the galaxy and, later, pursue aliens who launched a devastating attack on Earth. The series was originally called simply 'Enterprise,' then changed to 'Star Trek: Enterprise' in its third season."
Voyager, .77, .62, 7, "A starship is stranded in the uncharted Delta Quadrant in this fourth 'Star Trek' series, the first to feature a female captain. Here, the crew grudgingly teams with Maquis rebels to try to return to Earth after Voyager is hurtled 70,000 light-years from Federation space. The show's two-hour premiere coincided with the UPN network's launch. Genevieve Bujold was originally cast as Janeway, but was replaced by Kate Mulgrew after only a few days of filming."
DS9, .85, .80, 7, "Different races try to coexist peacefully in the third `Star Trek' spin-off. This one takes place on a 24th-century space station that serves as a frontier town on the edge of a wormhole that enables travelers to journey vast distances in short periods of time. The syndicated series included several characters from its predecessor, `Star Trek: The Next Generation,' and had a healthy seven-season run."
TNG, .89, .82, 7, "A new crew boards a revamped USS Enterprise in the first spin-off from the '60s cult classic."
Animated, .92, .78, 2. "Animated series following the adventures of the Starship Enterprise crew."
